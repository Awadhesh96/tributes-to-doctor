        <p2> <img src="image/mahesh.jpg" align="right" height="300" width="500"> BENGALURU: Ever since the second wave of infections hit, Karnataka has lost three doctors — Dr GN Ganesh Kumar, 59, from Chamarajanagar, Dr Mahesh, a paediatrician from district
            and Dr Ramegowda CC, 51, from Bengaluru — to Covid-19. All three had taken at least the first dose of the vaccine, their colleagues told TOI.
            <br><br><br> While Dr Ramegowda, founder and head of Rashi Diagnostic Centre, died on Thursday, Dr Ganesh, who worked as a medical officer in a general hospital in Kollegal taluk, breathed his last on Tuesday (April 27). Dr Mahesh, who worked
            in Channapatna general hospital, also succumbed to the virus April 18.<br><br><br> Office-bearers of Karnataka Government Medical Officers’ Association ( ) confirmed the deaths, saying the incidents have raised concern over the safety of healthcare
            professionals.
            <br><br><br> C Surendran, manager at Rashi Diagnostic Centre, told TOI that Dr Ramegowda’s family had contacted 22 hospitals, including private facilities, for a bed for him when his condition began deteriorating on April 11, three days after
            he tested positive. Dr Ramegowda had taken the first dose of Covid vaccine and had been checking with many hospitals for the second dose in early April, colleagues said.<br><br><br> Dr Ramegowda finally got admission in a private hospital

            23 and was in home isolation. He developed breathlessness on April 26 and got oxygen at home. The same day he fell unconscious and was taken to Mysuru district hospital. Since his condition did not improve, he was shifted to a private hospital.<br><br><br>            “He was declared dead on Tuesday. We learnt that Dr Ganesh had taken both doses of the vaccine, but we don’t know when he received the second dose. He was not willing to get hospitalised when he tested positive and wanted to be in home isolation
            as his symptoms were not severe initially,” said Dr Somanna, president, KGMOA, Chamarajanagar district.<br><br><br>

        <p1><img src="image/1.jpg" align="right" height="300" width="500"> 798When times got tough during the second wave of the COVID-19 crisis, many across India decided to step forward and take the lead in helping those is need. From providing food, oxygen,
            medicines, ambulance services to those who helped with last rites of those who succumbed to the disease. #SalutingTheCovidHeroes Townhall is an attempt to honour these people who restored faith in humanity at a time when many were going through
            trauma of death and suffering. Here are some highlights from the Townhall</p1>
    </div>
    <div class="a">
        <p2>
            'We have all been through a really excruciating period both physically and mentally and unfortunately, deeply emotionally', said Dr Prannoy Roy about the second wave of COVID-19 at NDTV-Dettol India's Saluting The COVID Heroes Townhall. Dr Roy sets the
            agenda for the Townhall, to express gratitude to ordinary people who worked relentlessly and selflessly to help India cope with the pandemic.

    <div class="a">
        <p3><img src="image/2.webp" align="right" height="300" width="500"> Campaign Ambassador Amitabh Bachchan, who got infected with COVID-19 last year in August and was admitted to a hospital, shared his experience of fighting the disease under expert
            guidance and care. Lauding the spirit of healthcare workers, Mr Bachchan said, 'You cannot believe the kind of effort they all make to make you comfortable. They don't go home; 24 hour, round-the-clock, they are there in their suits, in their
            attire, attending to you.'

    <div class="a">
        <p4><img src="image/3.jpg" align="right" height="300" width="500"> Laxman Narasimhan, CEO, Reckitt also joined the Townhall to pay his tribute to the COVID warriors. Appreciating the healthcare workers and other frontline warriors - people from the
            community who stood up to be counted, Mr Narasimhan said, 'They have in a lot of ways stitched India together in so many wonderful ways.'

    <div class="a">
        <p5><img src="image/4.jpg" align="right" height="300" width="500"> Gaurav Jain, SVP, South Asia, Reckitt too extended his support to the Townhall and highlighted the evolving role of Dettol during the two waves of the pandemic. When the pandemic began,
            Dettol's role was to educate people about COVID-19 appropriate behaviour - handwashing with soap, wearing a mask and keeping a social distance. However, this year during the second wave, their role evolved to being a harbinger of hope.

    <div class="a">
        <p6> <img src="image/5.webp" align="right" height="300" width="500"> Dr Randeep Guleria, Director of AIIMS appreciated the resilience of Indian citizens in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic which he believes has been ‘very heartening for healthcare workers'.

            been running a free ambulance service for ferrying patients for almost two decades now. Going beyond the call of duty, the couple fetches medicines, arranges funerals and sometimes, steps in to perform last rites as well

    <div class="a">
        <p8><img src="image/7.webp" align="right" height="300" width="500"> Various other heartwarming stories of love and care came up during the devastating second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Like the story of Ronita Krishna Sharma Rekhi, a lactating
            mother of a four-month-old girl, from Assam. Ms Rekhi volunteered to breastfeed newborns who have either lost their mothers to COVID-19 or whose mothers have tested positive and are in isolation.<br><br> Similarly, Dattatraya Sawant, a school
            teacher from Mumbai stepped up to help the coronavirus patients by providing a rickshaw service from hospital to home and vice versa for free.

            was also joined by a doctor couple from Mumbai - Dr Marcus Ranney and Dr Raina Ranney - who have extended a helping hand by providing medicines to people. Together they started Meds For More, a citizen-led initiative to collect unused or leftover
            and unexpired medicines from COVID recovered patients and provide them to those in need and cannot afford it.
